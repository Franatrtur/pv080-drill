*__Me__*: Create a PV080 drill page. pls pretty pls.

*__AI__*:
I'll create a static flashcard page for you using Bootstrap and jQuery, with the features you've requested. Here's a complete implementation that loads your JSON format and displays one question at a time, tracks statistics in localStorage, and provides feedback on answers.

I've created a comprehensive PV080 Drill flashcard system for you using Bootstrap and jQuery. The page is ready to use and includes all the features you requested:

## Features

1. **Card Display System**:
   - Shows one question at a time
   - Multiple-choice answer selection
   - Submit button that changes to "Next" after answering
   - Visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect answers)

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - All data saved to localStorage
   - Tracks which cards you've seen and mastered
   - Records your performance statistics

3. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Overall progress bar
   - Success rate percentage
   - Current answer streak
   - Total attempts counter
   - Mastery level breakdown with visual chart

4. **Card Mastery System**:
   - Cards are categorized as "New", "Learning", or "Mastered"
   - Difficulty badges show at a glance how well you know each card
   - Smart spaced repetition approach that helps focus on difficult cards

## How to Use

1. Simply load the HTML file in your browser
2. Answer the questions by clicking on answers you think are correct
3. Click "Submit" to check your answers
4. Click "Next" to move to the next question
5. Your progress is automatically saved between sessions

The page is already set up with sample questions from your JSON. To use your full question set, you would typically load it from an external file. I've included commented code for that purpose.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
